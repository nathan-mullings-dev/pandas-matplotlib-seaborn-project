## Overview 🌍

This repository showcases a hands-on workbook that provides practical experience with data analysis and visualization using Python libraries - **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** in **Google Colab**. The workbook is centered around working with GDP per capita data for various countries, allowing me to manipulate, analyze, and visualize economic data using Python.

## Proposal 💡

The goal of this workbook was to equip myself with the necessary tools to handle real-world datasets using Python in a cloud-based environment like **Google Colab**. Throughout this project, I have:
- **Learned how to work with data** using Pandas, including cleaning and transforming datasets. 🧹
- **Developed skills in data visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, insightful charts and graphs. 📉
- **Analyzed economic data** by working with GDP per capita data across countries, helping to understand economic disparities and trends on a global scale. 🌍

I used a publicly available GDP dataset from Kaggle, which provided a solid foundation for understanding how economic indicators fluctuate across different nations and years. By visualizing this data, I learned to identify patterns and trends in global economic development, which are crucial for making informed decisions in economics, business, and policy-making.

## Summary of Work Completed ✅

In this workbook, I:
- **Loaded and cleaned the data** using Pandas, handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis. 🔄
- **Explored GDP per capita trends** across different countries, examining how the data varies over time. 📊
- **Visualized key insights** using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including generating various plots such as line charts, scatter plots, and bar charts to highlight patterns in the data. 📉📈
- **Investigated economic trends** and compared GDP across countries, helping to understand disparities in wealth and economic development globally. 💰

Key steps and tasks I completed:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loaded the GDP per capita dataset from Kaggle, performed basic data cleaning, and handled missing values. 🔧
2. **Data Exploration**: Used descriptive statistics and Pandas functions to explore the dataset and prepare it for further analysis. 🔍
3. **Data Visualization**: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations, providing insights into global economic trends and comparisons. 📊
4. **Trend Analysis**: Identified trends in GDP per capita over time, using line and scatter plots to analyze country-specific performance. ⏳

## Learning Outcomes 🎯

By completing this workbook, I have:
- Gained proficiency in using **Pandas** for data manipulation, including data cleaning, filtering, and summarization. 🧑‍💻
- Developed skills in **data visualization** using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, creating informative and visually appealing charts. 🎨
- Learned how to analyze **GDP per capita** data across multiple countries, understanding global economic patterns. 🌍
- Enhanced my ability to **explore datasets** and derive meaningful insights through visualizations and statistical methods. 📑
- Gained hands-on experience in working with **real-world datasets** (e.g., Kaggle) and applying Python libraries to solve data analysis problems. 💪
- Familiarized myself with using **Google Colab**, an online environment for running Python code, which enables seamless sharing and collaboration. ☁️
